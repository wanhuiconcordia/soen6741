1. INTRODUCTION
2. DEFINITION OF MODEL
	A simplification, with respect to some goal, of a thing.
3. CHARACTERISTICS OF A MODEL
	satisfy the following criteria
		1. Mapping Criterion: There must be an ‘original’ that is mapped to the model.
		2. Reduction Criterion: The model must exhibit some, but not necessarily all, properties of the original.
		3. Pragmatic Criterion: The model must be able to replace the original for some purpose, that is, the model is useful.
4. HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF CONCEPTUAL MODELING
5. EXAMPLES OF MODELS
6. META-MODEL
	A meta-model is a model of a model.
7. MOTIVATION FOR MODELING
	Communicate with People
	Document Decisions
	Furnish(布置；装备；提供) Abstractions
	Understand Domain:A model could be used to understand the problem or the solution domain better
	Provide Structure
	To Explore and To Create:In general, for a single problem, there can be multiple solutions. A model could be used to explore multiple solutions. In doing so, models open avenues for experimentation, creative thinking, and innovation at relatively little cost. For example, a prototype is a kind of model used for this purpose. For another example, use case models can be used for software project estimation.
	Discover Errors
	Manage Risk
	Follow Trend

9. CLASSIFICATION OF MODELS
	9.1. PHYSICAL VERSUS CONCEPTUAL
	9.2. DESCRIPTIVE VERSUS PRESCRIPTIVE
		A model of a thing that already exists is a descriptive model. For example, a (problem) domain model or a user model (such as a persona) is a descriptive model.
		A descriptive model makes indicative statements. For example, a statement of the type “ ... X is Y ...” is an indicative statement.
		A model of a thing that does not (yet) exist is a prescriptive model. For example, a use case model is a prescriptive model.
		A prescriptive model makes putative statements. For example, a statement of the type “... X should do Y ...” is a putative statement.
	9.3. GENERATIVE VERSUS REFLECTIVE
10. GOAL OF A MODEL
	Goal										Type of Model
	Understand Value of Software System to an Organization				Business Model
	Understand Problem Domain 							Problem Domain Model
	Understand User									User Model
	Understand Interaction between a User and the Software System			Use Case Model
11. STAKEHOLDERS OF A MODEL
12. THE THING TO MODEL MAPPING
13. VIEWS IN SOFTWARE MODELING
14. CONCEPTUAL MODELS AS BOUNDARY OBJECTS
15. ON VIEWPOINTS AND VIEWS OF A MODEL
	the mapping between the set of things and the set of models is many-to-many
16. ABSTRACTION IN CONCEPTUAL MODELING
17. ON ‘SIMPLIFICATIONS’ OF A MODEL: Show Only What You Have to Show
18. MODALITY OF A MODEL
	TEXT VERSUS GRAPHICS
19. REPRESENTATION AND PRESENTATION OF A MODEL
	The representation of a model is relevant to machines. The presentation of a model is relevant to humans.
	The separation between representation and presentation of a model is important for a variety of reasons, including productivity, reusability, and maintainability.
20. MEDIUM OF A MODEL
21. DEFINITION OF CONCEPTUAL MODELING
	The activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around usfor purposes of understanding and communication (serve the goals).
22. THE PROCESS OF CONCEPTUAL MODELING
