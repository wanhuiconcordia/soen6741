1. INTRODUCTION
2. DEFINITION OF MODEL
	A simplification, with respect to some goal, of a thing.
3. CHARACTERISTICS OF A MODEL
	satisfy the following criteria
		1. Mapping Criterion: There must be an ‘original’ that is mapped to the model.
		2. Reduction Criterion: The model must exhibit some, but not necessarily all, properties of the original.
		3. Pragmatic Criterion: The model must be able to replace the original for some purpose, that is, the model is useful.
4. HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF CONCEPTUAL MODELING
5. EXAMPLES OF MODELS
6. META-MODEL
	A meta-model is a model of a model.
7. MOTIVATION FOR MODELING
	Communicate with People
	Document Decisions
	Furnish(布置；装备；提供) Abstractions
	Understand Domain:A model could be used to understand the problem or the solution domain better
	Provide Structure
	To Explore and To Create:In general, for a single problem, there can be multiple solutions. A model could be used to explore multiple solutions. In doing so, models open avenues for experimentation, creative thinking, and innovation at relatively little cost. For example, a prototype is a kind of model used for this purpose. For another example, use case models can be used for software project estimation.
	Discover Errors
	Manage Risk
	Follow Trend

9. CLASSIFICATION OF MODELS
	9.1. PHYSICAL VERSUS CONCEPTUAL
	9.2. DESCRIPTIVE VERSUS PRESCRIPTIVE
		A model of a thing that already exists is a descriptive model. For example, a (problem) domain model or a user model (such as a persona) is a descriptive model.
		A descriptive model makes indicative statements. For example, a statement of the type “ ... X is Y ...” is an indicative statement.
		A model of a thing that does not (yet) exist is a prescriptive model. For example, a use case model is a prescriptive model.
		A prescriptive model makes putative statements. For example, a statement of the type “... X should do Y ...” is a putative statement.
	9.3. GENERATIVE VERSUS REFLECTIVE
10. GOAL OF A MODEL
	Goal										Type of Model
	Understand Value of Software System to an Organization				Business Model
	Understand Problem Domain 							Problem Domain Model
	Understand User									User Model
	Understand Interaction between a User and the Software System			Use Case Model
11. STAKEHOLDERS OF A MODEL
12. THE THING TO MODEL MAPPING
13. VIEWS IN SOFTWARE MODELING
14. CONCEPTUAL MODELS AS BOUNDARY OBJECTS
15. ON VIEWPOINTS AND VIEWS OF A MODEL
	the mapping between the set of things and the set of models is many-to-many
16. ABSTRACTION IN CONCEPTUAL MODELING
17. ON ‘SIMPLIFICATIONS’ OF A MODEL: Show Only What You Have to Show
18. MODALITY OF A MODEL
	TEXT VERSUS GRAPHICS
19. REPRESENTATION AND PRESENTATION OF A MODEL
	The representation of a model is relevant to machines. The presentation of a model is relevant to humans.
	The separation between representation and presentation of a model is important for a variety of reasons, including productivity, reusability, and maintainability.
20. MEDIUM OF A MODEL
21. DEFINITION OF CONCEPTUAL MODELING
	The activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around usfor purposes of understanding and communication (serve the goals).
22. THE PROCESS OF CONCEPTUAL MODELING: say nothing, garbage

24. LITERATE MODELING
	The goal to make computer programs more communicable led to a style of programming known as Literate Programming.
25. PAIR MODELING
26. SITUATING CONCEPTUAL MODELING IN A SOFTWARE PROCESS
27. MODELING MATURITY
	Maturity Level		Activity/Artifact
	Level 0			No Specification
	Level 1			Textual
	Level 2			Text with Diagrams
	Level 3			Models with Text
	Level 4			Precise Models(Use of Object Constraint Language (OCL).)
	Level 5			Models Only
28. PRINCIPLES OF MODELING
	Principle 1. The choice of what models to create has a profound influence on how a problem is [approached] and how a solution is shaped.
	Principle 2. Every model may be expressed at different levels of precision.
	Principle 3. The best models are connected to reality.
		by definition, all models need to simplify reality; the trick is ensuring that the simplifications do not mask any important details.
	Principle 4. No single model or view is sufficient.
	Principle 5. Keep abstraction levels consistent.
	Principle 6. Keep related models consistent.
29. LANGUAGES FOR CONCEPTUAL MODELING
	The selection of a modeling language can vary on a number of criteria including
		applicability (that is, suitability for purpose)
		expressivity (of information)
		formality(mathematical ‘rigor’ 10 )
		learnability (by stakeholders)
		modality (of notation)
		support (say, through standardization, adoption, presence of tools, and so on)

	The notation of modeling language:
		primary notation:representation. 
		secondary notation: presentation.
30. TOOLS FOR CONCEPTUAL MODELING(modeler)
31. MANAGEMENT OF CONCEPTUAL MODELS
32. QUALITY OF CONCEPTUAL MODELS
	Definition [Quality of Conceptual Model]:The totality of characteristics of a conceptual model that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs
				承受/满足 明确和隐含 需要的 能力
	expressiveness is a lexical quality
	correctness is a syntactic quality
	consistency is a semantic quality
	accessibility is a pragmatic quality
	credibility is a social quality
34. ORGANIZING ELEMENTS OF A MODEL
35. PERCEPTION IN CONCEPTUAL MODELING
	there are six main factors that determine how humans group things according to visual perception:
		Proximity
		Similarity
		Closure
		Symmetry
		Uniform Destiny (Common Fate)
		Continuity
